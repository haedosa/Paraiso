(Vector v, Ring.C g) seems to be unnecessary in many positions.
let us try removing them.
Removing them may not be so easy. some parts are inferred, 
some are required and recursively required. hmhm..

names must be strictly qualified.
Exceptions are internal modules (Language.Paraiso.*) and base.

let us make Language.Paraiso.Prelude include fundamental abstraction
modules, upto Traversable. and let Language.Paraiso.Prelude hide their
lesser counterparts from Prelude.
